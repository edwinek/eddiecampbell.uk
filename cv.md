I’m a principal engineer at FanDuel, where I work in the Engineering
Productivity team. Having transitioned to development from a fairly extensive
test automation career I bring a grounded and quality-focused approach to what I
do.

With a long time personal interest in Linux and networking, I am effective in
modern cloud-based, containerised development environments and have strong
hands-on troubleshooting skills. The streamlining of engineer workflows is
something I am very keen on and so am always on the lookout for pragmatic
opportunities to automate or optimise tasks.

Over the years I have experienced development life-cycles of varying levels of
agility and with this I believe that finding the balance between a pragmatic
approach and best practice is key to success. In addition, enabling others is at
the very core of what is important to me as an engineer and so I aim to include
mentoring and information sharing into what I do.
