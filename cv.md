I am a software generalist with over 20 years experience in a variety of roles.

With a long time personal interest in Linux and networks I am effective in
modern cloud-based, containerised development environments and have strong
hands-on troubleshooting skills. The streamlining of engineer workflows is
something I am very keen on and so am always on the lookout for practical
opportunities to automate or optimise tasks.

Over the years I have experienced development life-cycles of varying levels of
agility and with this I believe that finding the balance between a pragmatic
approach and best practice is key to success. Enabling others is at the very
core of what is important to me as an engineer and so I aim to include mentoring
and information sharing into what I do.

## Experience

Initially as a developer at FanDuel I worked on backend services using an in
house framework (Java / Guice / Hibernate / SQS / SNS) running on AWS EC2.
While eventually specialising in login / authentication flows, I gained
experience in most of the available landscape during this time. As a developer I
was the technical lead on some large scale and complex customer account
migration activities, in consolidation efforts as the company grew.

Later, I spent time working as part of an enablement / developer experience team
("Engineering Productivity"), where my primary focus was on improving developer
/ tester workflows. The EngProd team spent considerable focus on improving test
environment availability and stability. As a consequence we allowed engineers to
obtain their own environment in under 5sec, as opposed to the previous ~45min.
The team facilitated weekly and highly attended demos and talks, featuring
internal and external speakers. EngProd also created and ran multi-day workshops
on various subjects including Terraform, AWS and docker, that we ran in the
Edinburgh and New York City offices.

Following this my focus was on improving DevOps tooling, and assisting on
migrating applications from EC2 to Kubernetes.

My work as a Senior Staff led to returning to product development, where I am
currently operate across several teams in the "Account" vertical. Account are
responsible for customer sign up and KYC onboarding, as well as customised offer
/ acquisition / experimentation.
